A. False becuase flipping INT_MIN gives an overflow
	y = INT_MIN and x = -69
	left side = true
	right side = false


B. False probably a lot. If x or y is big enough, left hand side will overflow and result is unpredictable

C. False
	y = INT_MAX and x = INT_MAX 
	left side = 1
	right side = 0

D. False because (y - x)'s sign bit could be flipped, causing the unsigned casting to give the wrong number

E. True becuase concatanating the bits can only lose information

F. True because the (ux & (-1 << 31)) accounts for the missing arithmatic bit if needed

G. True because 8 is a power of 2
