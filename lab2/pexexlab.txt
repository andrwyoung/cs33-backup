Gather information about traces:
$ gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-26.1

Set breakpoint at Ftimes function
(gdb) b Ftimes
Output: Breakpoint 1 at 0x54e0f0: file ../../emacs-26.1/src/data.c, line 2943.

Set dissassemble-next-line on as instructed in assignment
(gdb) set disassemble-next-line on

Record outputs to gdb.txt
(gdb) set logging on
Output: Copying output to gdb.txt.

Actually start the debugging. r for run
(gdb) run -Q -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))'

Use 
(gdb) si
(gdb) info r
to figure out the info in the registers as well as the instructions each take

used some sed commands to clean up a bit
sed 's/0x[0]*//g' to get rid of 0x
sed 's/<.*>://g' to get rid of function name
sed 's/\s*\s/\t/g' to get rid of spaces







$ gcc -O2 -c testovf.c
$ objdump -d testovf.o

$ gcc -O2 -fwrapv -c testovf.c
$ objdump -d testovf.o 

$ gcc -O2 -fsanitize=undefined -c testovf.c
didn't work. forgot to append path
$ PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
tried again. worked this time
$ objdump -d testovf.o
