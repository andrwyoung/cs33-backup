A) The main thread didn't wait for the thread to finish 
So it just went on ahead and exited without it. Sad

B) We can either use pthread_join or pthread_exit
This will wait for the thread to finish before exiting

echo_cnt is thread safe in this example
since server uses echo_cnt to service different clients
and it has a mutex to protect it from itself
if it served the same client, there might be problems

echo_cnt is not reentrant though
since it uses the global variables
so it would reuse the same mutex
and walk over itself
